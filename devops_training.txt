pass: wJ9eP24q
=============================

Devops: AWS not AZURE
version control: ex:github,
types of version control
1. centrilized(svn(tool), inazure(tfcv)) :the dev's cant clone repo into system, the user directly making changes on server/platform.
2.Distrubuted(git):it will help to clone repo in system to make changes and push it back to server.

advantages:
D:internet connection only required when interacting with server.
git is usfull incase bcs all dev's have a copy so backup is eazy
disAdv:
C: more secure than D one as it is in one place.
in C backup is difficult

about git and github:
---------------------
git is tool,
this will very helpfull reason most of the platform uses git tool commands.


github is a platforms/server which support the git tool and it helps to keep ur files and 
folders and also assist us to share the code with other people

its help git tool to perform,
ex: github, bitbuket,azure devops,teamcity,git lab
local: C:\Program Files\Git
