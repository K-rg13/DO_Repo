what is terraform and enzible?

terraform:
creating instance:
cn be done in below steps, login to aws create manually like yesturday
2. aws cli in which u will write script to create a resources
IAC= infrastucture as code to create a service.

many tools to do the above in that terraform is best,
it can be used in 
azure ===> arm templates/azure biceps
, aws ===> it has its own terraform call cloud formations
, gcp,
 on premessis

 but using terraform we can work with any of the platform
 any terraform its extenstion will .tf
 called 
 main.tf:
// to tell it we have blocks which give the info of cloud service provider
//code:
provider "aws/azure/" {
    region = "us-west-1"
}
//2nd block is for resources, creating a new resources into cloud platforms
//code: second can be anything to define
resources 'aws_s3_buket' 'name/abc/xyz and soon' {
    bucket = 'kokila'
    //control list u can access the perticular file.
    acl = 'public-read'
}
// we can create a multiple resources on one localtion

then open a terminal or command promt
commands:
1.terraform init // it looks for the provider informartion and it will get the dependency or executable files on ur directory
then> success msg will come

> before execute we need to do aws Configure
2. aws Configure //to run any command first we need to authenticate so we use this
then> it will ask the id,>go to aws >account>
security credentials> access key> generate it> get the access value and pass it in command
id: access key
secret: access secret
region: we can pass or none
format:  ---||---

the above process complete the authenticate using aws config command

3. terraform plan //if u run the main.tf then what will be the process of code and its impact just like varification process.
output: will list the creation/edition/destory/ of the resourses.
in end it will provide the status below

4. terraform apply // it is final command , it will ask for confirmation, once yes then it will start creating on resources
